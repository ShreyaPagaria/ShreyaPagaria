# Hi, I'm Shreya Pagaria üëã

### About Me
üöÄ I'm a Master's student in AI and Chemical Engineering with a focus on data science, data engineering, and machine learning. With hands-on experience using **PySpark**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Python**, I'm skilled in handling large datasets, building scalable data pipelines, and deriving meaningful insights.

üîç Currently open to internship opportunities, I‚Äôm eager to apply my expertise in **Spark DataFrames**, **ETL processes**, and **ML workflows** to tackle complex, real-world challenges. Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre working on innovative data-driven projects!

### üíº Projects
- **[Soccer Player Statistics Analysis and Prediction (2015-2022)](#)**  in collaboration with Eesha Kulkarni
  - Conducted data integration by ingesting soccer player statistics into a PostgreSQL database with a unified schema.
  - Developed PySpark models using Linear Regression (RMSE: 1.00) and Decision Tree Regression (RMSE: 1.58) with hyperparameter tuning.
  - Built Deep MLP (RMSE: 0.69) and Dense MLP (RMSE: 0.81) models in PyTorch for player rating prediction, leveraging feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization
  - Deployed analytics and ML workflows on the cloud, integrating PostgreSQL for data management.
  
- **[F1 Race Data Analysis (1950-2024)](#)**  
  - working on analysing decades of F1 race data to explore patterns in winning strategies, driver performances, and team evolution.

- **[RuO2-Based Ink Experimentation](#)**
  - Led RuO2-based experimental research, leveraging drop-casting and optimizing ink preparation techniques to enhance material properties
  - Increased experiment efficiency by 85% through adaptive methodology refinements, enhancing overall project outcomes
