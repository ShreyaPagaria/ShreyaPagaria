# Hi, I'm Shreya Pagaria 👋

### About Me
🚀 I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence - Chemical Engineering with a focus on data science, data engineering, and machine learning. With hands-on experience using **PySpark**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Python**, I'm skilled in handling large datasets, building scalable data pipelines, and deriving meaningful insights.

🔍 Currently open to full-time roles that combine **data engineering ** and **machine learning** to drive impactful, production-ready solutions. I’m eager to apply my expertise in designing scalable ML pipelines, data processing, deep learning, and distributed training pipelines using **PySpark, PyTorch, and HPC systems.** Let’s connect if you’re working on innovative data-driven projects!

### 💼 Projects

- **[Time Series Anomaly Detection | Carnegie Mellon University)](#)**  in collaboration with Kitchin Group
  -_ Graduate Student Researcher _
  - Leading benchmarking and co-authoring an ongoing research study on time-series anomaly detection, developing an LSTM-FCN model (98.91% test accuracy) that currently outperforms XGBoost, LSTM baselines on the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset.

-  **[Spotify to MP3 Converter](https://github.com/ShreyaPagaria/MusicMate)**
  - This is a **Spotify to MP3 converter** that allows users to easily convert Spotify playlists into downloadable MP3 files. The app processes Spotify playlist URLs and provides a simple way to download each track via links that redirect to the corresponding MP3 files hosted on the server.
  

- **[Soccer Player Statistics Analysis and Prediction (2015-2022)](#)**  in collaboration with Eesha Kulkarni
  - Conducted data integration by ingesting soccer player statistics into a PostgreSQL database with a unified schema.
  - Developed PySpark models using Linear Regression (RMSE: 1.00) and Decision Tree Regression (RMSE: 1.58) with hyperparameter tuning.
  - Built Deep MLP (RMSE: 0.69) and Dense MLP (RMSE: 0.81) models in PyTorch for player rating prediction, leveraging feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization
  - Deployed analytics and ML workflows on the cloud, integrating PostgreSQL for data management.
  
- **[F1 Race Data Analysis (1950-2024)](#)**  
  - working on analysing decades of F1 race data to explore patterns in winning strategies, driver performances, and team evolution.
