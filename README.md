# Hi, I'm Shreya Pagaria 👋

### About Me
🚀 I'm a Master's student in AI and Chemical Engineering with a focus on data science, data engineering, and machine learning. With hands-on experience using **PySpark**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Python**, I'm skilled in handling large datasets, building scalable data pipelines, and deriving meaningful insights.

🔍 Currently open to internship opportunities, I’m eager to apply my expertise in **Spark DataFrames**, **ETL processes**, and **ML workflows** to tackle complex, real-world challenges. Let’s connect if you’re working on innovative data-driven projects!
