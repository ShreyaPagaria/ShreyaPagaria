## 🚀 About Me
👋 Hi there! I’m a Master’s student in AI and Chemical Engineering with a focus on data science, engineering, and machine learning. With extensive experience using PySpark, PostgreSQL, and Python, I’m skilled in handling large datasets, building scalable data pipelines, and deriving meaningful insights.

🔍 Currently open to internship opportunities, I’m eager to apply my expertise in Spark DataFrames, ETL processes, and ML workflows to tackle complex, real-world challenges. Let’s connect if you’re working on innovative data-driven projects!
