# Hi, I'm Shreya Pagaria 👋

### About Me
🚀 I'm a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence - Chemical Engineering with a focus on data science, data engineering, and machine learning. With hands-on experience using **PySpark**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Python**, I'm skilled in handling large datasets, building scalable data pipelines, and deriving meaningful insights.

Currently open to full-time roles that combine **data engineering** and **machine learning** to drive impactful, production-ready solutions. I’m eager to apply my expertise in designing scalable ML pipelines, data processing, deep learning, and distributed training pipelines using **PySpark, PyTorch, and HPC systems.** Let’s connect if you’re working on innovative data-driven projects!

### Projects
- **[Agentic Financial Fraud Detector](#)**  
  - Built a multi-model fraud detection system (XGBoost, RF, AE, IF) with SHAP interpretability, LLM-based explanations, and adversarial robustness evaluation via noise and camouflage attacks.

- **[Time Series Anomaly Detection | Carnegie Mellon University)](#)**  in collaboration with Kitchin Group (_Graduate Student Researcher_)
  - Leading benchmarking and co-authoring an ongoing research study on time-series anomaly detection, developing an LSTM-FCN model (99.04% test accuracy) that currently outperforms XGBoost, LSTM baselines on the Tennessee Eastman Process dataset.

- **[Solid State Synthesis | Carnegie Mellon University)](#)**  in collaboration with Dr. Evan Spotte-Smith (_Graduate Student Researcher_)
  - Assisted in preprocessing benchmark data using Pymatgen, MDTraj and LAMMPS trajectory files for CEGANN model, testing it on benchmark datasets in collaboration with Toyota Research Institute

-  **[Spotify to MP3 Converter](https://github.com/ShreyaPagaria/MusicMate)**
  -  This is a **Spotify to MP3 converter** that allows users to easily convert Spotify playlists into downloadable MP3 files. The app processes Spotify playlist URLs and provides a simple way to download each track via links that redirect to the corresponding MP3 files hosted on the server.
  
- **[F1 Race Data Analysis (1950-2024)](#)**  
  - working on analysing decades of F1 race data to explore patterns in winning strategies, driver performances, and team evolution.
